# EnsembleXGBoost
A Mini-project evaluating ensemble methods for XGBoost in a federated setting using the Higgs Boson dataset.

This project evaluated different approaches to ensemble XGBoost. This includes building a XGBoost model at each site then having the models vote on the outcome. I also used logistic regression to weigh the votes but this led to overfitting.
